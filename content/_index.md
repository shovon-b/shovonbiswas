## Hello!

I completed my Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the University of British Columbia, Canada, in July 2025 under the supervision of Prof. [Gordon Semenoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Walter_Semenoff). Before that, I did my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology**.

## Research

My Ph.D. research broadly revolved around quantum field theories. Currently, I am transitioning into machine learning research. I am interested in both the training dynamics of large neural networks and interpretability.
